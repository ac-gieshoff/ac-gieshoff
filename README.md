I am interested in the effects of stress, cognitive load and effort on human behavior and conference interpreting in particular. 
To investigate these effects, I use different applications, such as R, Python and praat.
You will find in this repository some of the scripts I used to analyze data with R, to extract voice features with praat or process files with Python.
